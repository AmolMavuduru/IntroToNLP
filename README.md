This is the GitHub repo for NLP workshop for the 2018 AI Conference at UT Dallas.
Please install the following dependencies to run the code in the Jupyter notebook:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- SciKit-Learn
- Matplotlib (optional - for data visualization)

We recommend getting the Anaconda distribution of Python, which you can download from
here: https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos

This distribution already comes with some of the above libraries, as well as the Jupyter application for running Jupyter notebooks. To install the above packages using Anaconda, just issue a command in your terminal in the following format:

**conda install <library-name>**

For example, to install Numpy, you can issue the command **conda install numpy**. We have listed the Anaconda installation commands for all of the libraries below for your convenience.

- **conda install numpy**
- **conda install pandas**
- **conda install sklearn**
- **conda install matplotlib**
