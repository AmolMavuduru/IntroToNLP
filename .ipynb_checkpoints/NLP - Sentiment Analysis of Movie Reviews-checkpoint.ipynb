    "### TF-IDF: A More Sophisticated Bag of Words Model\n",
    "So far we have only worked with a simple bag of words model where we just count the frequencies of each vocabulary word in each document. However, one problem with this simple approach is that for a large corpus, words that frequently appear in the English language will have larger components when in reality, they do not contribute much to the overall meaning of each document. \n",
    "\n",
    "**TF-IDF**, short for **term frequency-inverse document frequency** is another bag of words approach that attempts to solve this problem. Rather than just computing the raw frequencies of each word in a document, the TF-IDF approach involves multiplying these frequencies by the **inverse** of statistics representing the **frequencies of these words in the entire corpus**. The TF-IDF statistic is basically the **product** of the **term frequency** and **inverse document frequency** statistics as demonstrated in the equation below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "TFIDF(t, d, D) = f_{t, d} \\bullet log\\frac{N_D} {n_t}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $t$, $d$, and $D$ are the **term (word or n-gram)**, **document**, and **corpus** respectively.\n",
    "- $f_{t,d}$ is the **term-frequency statistic**, which is just the **raw frequency** of the term $t$ in the document $d$.\n",
    "- $N_D$ is the **total number of documents** in the corpus $D$.\n",
    "- $n_t$ is the **number of documents** in which the term $t$ appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that if a word appears in **every document**, which means $N_D = n_t$, then the TF-IDF statistic for that word will be zero because in that case $\\frac{N_D} {n_t} = 1$ and $log(1) = 0$. This means words in the English language that are very common but do not contribute much to the meaning of the documents will likely have near-zero TF-IDF scores.

    "### Naive Bayes for Sentiment Classification\n",
    "Naive bayes is a very simple classification algorithm with fast training times and generally good performance for text classification tasks. It involves applying Bayes' Theorem with the \"naive\" assumption that all of the features are independent from each other. Naive bayes is based on the concept of conditional probability. Given an instance of $n$ features $x = (x_1, ... x_n)$ and a set of $k$ classes $C = (C_1, ..., C_k)$, this algorithm assigns conditional probabilities in the following form for each of the $k$ classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "p(C_k \\space| \\space (x_1, ..., x_n))\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The expression above basically represents the probability of the class $C_k$ given the features in $x$. In the context of our sentiment analysis problem, there are two classes (1 and 0) where one represents a positive review and the other represents a negative review. The feature vector $x$ for this problem is basically the TF-IDF vector with the scores for each word in the corpus for a particular review. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' Theorem, with reference to this conditional probability is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "p(C_k \\space| \\space x) = \\frac{p(C_k)p(x \\space | \\space C_k)}{p(x)}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, this theorem, in the context of our problem, states that the probability of a review being belonging to a specific class $C_k$ (ie. positive or negative) is equal to the probability of the class $C_k$ multiplied by the probability of the TF-IDF vector $x$ given that it belongs to the class $C_k$ divided by the probability of the TF-IDF vector $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can expand the conditional probability of the TF-IDF vector as a product of each of the conditional probabilities of each of its components with respect to the class $C_k$. Let's assume that the vector $x$ has the components $x_1$, $x_2$, ... $x_n$. Then our equation becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "p(C_k \\space | \\space x) = \\frac{p(C_k)p(x_1 \\space | \\space C_k)p(x_2 \\space | \\space C_k)...p(x_n \\space| \\space C_k)}{p(x_1)p(x_2)...p(x_n)}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "We can expand $p(x)$ and $p(x \\space | \\space C_k)$ as products because naive bayes is based on the \"naive\" assumption that **each of our features are independent**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these equations and a TF-IDF vector for a given review, the naive bayes algorithm involves calculating the conditional probability of each possible class given the features in the vector and then selecting the **class with the highest conditional probability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculating the probability of each feature\n",
    "One question that remains in our discussion of this algorithm is how can we can actually calculate the probability of each feature in the TF-IDF vector? There are a few different versions of naive bayes that use different probability distributions to calculate the probability of each feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gaussian Naive Bayes - The Normal/Gaussian Distribution\n",
    "Gaussian naive bayes, which is perhaps the simplest, assumes that each feature belongs to a **normal** or **gaussian** distribution. The behavior of the normal distribution is determined by two parameters, the **mean** and the **standard deviation**. A standard normal distribution has a **mean of 0** and a **standard deviation of 1**. The standard normal distribution can be graphed using the following equation (the PDF or probability density function of the distribution):\n",

    "### Logistic Regression for Sentiment Classification\n",
    "Unlike what the name suggest, **logistic regression** is designed specifically for **classification** and is especially suited for **binary classification** problems. The real **\"regression\"** in logistic regression involves finding the best values in a weight vector that is used to compute a weighted sum of the input features. This weighted sum is then passed to a function called the **sigmoid function** also known as the **logistic function**. This function has a special property where it takes any real-valued input and outputs a continuous value between 0 and 1. In general, if the output of this function is below 0.5 we can assign the input to class 0 and if the output is greater than or equal to 0.5, we can assign the input to class 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Logistic Regression Works\n",
    "The **logistic function** is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\phi (z) = \\frac {1} {1+e^{-z}}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "To better illustrate the concept of the **logistic function**, the function has been plotted below in the interval [-10, 10]. Notice how the function forms an S-shaped curve with horizonal asymptotes at y = 0 and y = 1. What's special about this function is that it can take any real value and output a value between 0 and 1, which is really useful for representing probabilities."

    "- $ p(y=1 \\ | \\ x) $ is the conditional probability that given an input $ x $, the data point belongs to the class $ y = 1 $. For our case, this is probability that given the values of variables like Gender, Age, Class, etc. that a person survived the Titanic.\n",
    "- $ w = (w_0, w_1, ..., w_n) $ represents a vector of numerical weights that will be used to compute the weighted sum of the inputs.\n",
    "- $ w^T x $ is just a short way to write the weighted sum of the features using matrix notation. Since x and w are actually just one dimensional matrices (vectors), this is basically equivalent to taking the dot product of x and w (multiply each feature by each corresponding weight and add them up!).\n",

    "    1 &\\text{if } \\phi(w^T x) \\ge 0.5\\\\\n",

    "#### How the model learns the weights\n",
    "The process of \"learning\" in logistic regression involves determining the **optimal weights** in the weight vector to **minimize** a cost function defined below for a weight vector $w$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "Cost(w) = \\sum_{i=0}^n \\frac {1} {2} (\\hat y_i - y_i)^2 + \\frac {\\lambda} {2} \\sum_{j=1}^m |w_{j}^2|\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the first part of this function is essentially half the sum of squared errors between the predicted values (classes) denoted as $\\hat y_i$ for the ith observation in the data and the actual values, denoted as $y_i$ for the ith observation in the data. For a given weight vector $w$ and an input $x_i$ we know that $\\hat y_i = \\phi(w^T x_i)$ based on the equation for the logistic regression algorithm. The second half of the equation, $ \\frac {\\lambda} {2} \\sum_{j=1}^m w_{j}^2 $ is known as the regularization term and is used to control the values of weights by adding a constant times the square of the magnitude of the weight vector to the cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why do we call it a cost function? What is the purpose of a cost function?\n",
    "The cost function is used to quantify how bad our classifier is doing at making predictions on training data. Cost functions are sometimes called **loss functions** but the idea is the same - both tell us how bad our classifier is doing and in general, we want to **minimize** the values of these functions, which is like minimizing a cost or loss. In algorithms that involve learning numerical weights, cost functions give our algorithms a metric for which to learn the optimal weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How do we actually minimize the cost function\n",
    "The process of minimizing the cost function involves an optimization process known as **gradient descent**. The idea behind gradient descent is that we can exploit the fact that our cost function is quadratic by looking at the direction in which our cost function is changing with respect to the weights (basically a derivative) and update our weights in a manner that causes our cost function to continue decreasing until we reach the global minimum, or the vertex of our quadratic curve. The mathematical details of this optimization method are out of the scope of this workshop, but are commonly used in deep learning and if you are interested, you can read more here: http://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gradient_descent.html\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is regularization? \n",
    "Regularization is a common practice in machine learning used to control **overfitting** - the situation in which a model becomes too constrained to the patterns in the training data and fails to generalize to unseen data. Regularization works by adding a term that involves the magnitude of the weight vector to the cost function. Doing so penalizes larger weights and prevents any one feature from receiving too much weight in the model. There are two common types of regularization used for logistic regression and those are L2 and L1 regularization. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **L2 Regularization**: This form of regularization is the same as regularization used in the original cost function above and involves the regularization term $ \\frac {\\lambda} {2} \\sum_{j=1}^m w_{j}^2 $.\n",
    "- **L1 Regularization**: This form of regularization involves a different regularization term $ \\frac {\\lambda} {2} \\sum_{j=1}^m |w_{j}| $. The difference here is that we are summing the absolute values of each weight and multipyling by a constant. L1 regularization tends to produce weight vectors where less important features have weights that are close to, if not exactly zero. For this reason, this type of regularization is often good for feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The constant related to logistic regression that we use to optimize the amount of regularization is referred to as $ C $ and is related to the regularization parameter $ \\lambda $ by the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "C = \\frac {1} {\\lambda}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "When training a logistic regression model in SciKit-Learn we can pass in values for C and specify the type of regularization that we want to use."
